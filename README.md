# PE
This repository includes my solutions and in-progress code for PE. I understand that PE asks users not publish solutions. In fact, PE states that members spoiling problems on public repositories (including on GitHub) will have their accounts locked.

For a website such as PE where many of these solutions can already be found online, I do not see an issue with posting my solutions as a matter of convenience for myself. A quick Google search shows plenty of GitHub repos or other websites advertising that they have hundreds of solutions. As you will see, I do not have nearly that many solutions here.

I have attempted to abbreviate the title of the website as "PE" everywhere in an attempt to limit searchability. I've only included the problem number and problem title within filenames and the comments of each file. If you have found this repo searching for answers, I encourage you to learn from my files and understand why I have set them up the way I have before you submit an answer as your own.
